# PUPy
PUPy provides a large amount of context information through a simple interface, by taking in sensor data and condensing it into three values - privacy, unfamiliarity, and proximity, which each describe a different aspect of the context.

# Development

In order to build upon PUPy, you can fork this repository and open this folder in Android Studio. From there, gradle will handle downloading and building dependencies.
